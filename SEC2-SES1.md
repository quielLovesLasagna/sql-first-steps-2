# Section 2 - Session 1 - Starting SQL Server

- ## Creating a database

A database is nothing more than a container of tables, queries, functions, etc... It is also a holder of security to ensure that people who don't have access to the database can't get in.

To create a database, do the following:

  - Right-click on the word **Databases** in the **Object Explorer** and click new Database:

![creating a database](./assets/creatingADatabase.png)

  - Add a name for the database and click **OK**
